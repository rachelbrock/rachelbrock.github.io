                    <h2>Journalist, Videographer, Storyteller</h2>
                    <p>Student at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism </p>

                    <p> I was born and raised in South Baltimore, Maryland. I attended
                        Baltimore School for the Arts for high school, which was the catalyst for my love of
                        storytelling. With
                        the speaking and
                        interpersonal skills I gained through the Baltimore School for the Arts, I decided to pursue
                        a
                        new method of storytelling: journalism. My ultimate goal is to become an international
                        broadcast
                        reporter who tells the stories of people around the world. I also hope to run a food blog
                        that
                        reviews all of the dishes I try in my travels.</p>
