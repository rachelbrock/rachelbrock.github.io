                <p> <b> Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989) is an American
                    singer-songwriter. Her versatile artistry, songwriting, entrepreneurship, marketability, and support
                    for
                    the Kansas City Chiefs have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her
                    life
                    is a subject of widespread media coverage.</p>
                <p>Swift began professional songwriting at 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and achieved
                    prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006), Fearless (2008), and Speak
                    Now
                    (2010). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were crossover
                    successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame.</p>
                <p>Her fourth studio album, Red (2012), experimented with electronic elements and featured her first
                    Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". Swift recalibrated
                    her
                    image from country to pop with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs
                    "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced
                    Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>
                <p>After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and
                    the
                    autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020
                    albums
                    Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled
                    Taylor's Version[a] after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs
                    "Cruel
                    Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well", and "Is It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour
                    (2023â€“2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of
                    all
                    time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long
                    Pond
                    Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).</p>
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is named after

                <p>At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre

                    productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later
                    shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to
                    just
                    run around the block four times and daydream about everything".</p>
                <p>When Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped
                    with
                    her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[29] In 2003, Swift and her

                    Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a
                    Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels</p>

                <p>In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums.
                    Media outlets extensively covered the tour's cultural and economic impact, and its US leg broke
                    the record for the most tickets sold in a day. Ticketmaster received public and political
                    criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales. The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing
                    tour in history, collecting over $1 billion. Its concert film, released to theaters
                    worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert
