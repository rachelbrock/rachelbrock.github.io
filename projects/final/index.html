                    TikTok is a barrage of curated content, selected to cater towards people‚Äôs ever shortening attention
                    spans. Many people can scroll aimlessly for hours without growing bored. But, what many users do not
                    know, is that the videos they are viewing hold a profound impact on their consumer spending habits.
                    The overlap of entertainment and advertisement has given TikTok an enormous influence over its
                    audience.
                </p>
                <h3>The Infinite Loop</h3>

                <p>TikTok has perfected a tactic they like to call <a
                        href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/infinite-loop-tiktok-retail-path-to-purchase?redirected=1">The
                        Infinite Loop</a>. With traditional marketing
                    strategies becoming obsolete, the social media app has created an entirely new method of grabbing
                    consumer attention. </p>

                <p>Instead of trying to market just any product to users, TikTok uses algorithms in order to promote
                    products that appeal to the user‚Äôs interests. Sellers are encouraged to make content about their
                    product that entertains the audience. Users may watch the videos, follow the sellers and then
                    eventually buy the product that is being advertised. </p>

                <img src="images/TikToks-retail-path.png.webp" alt="Loop graphic">

                <p> The key to the ‚Äúinfinite loop‚Äù is in the relationship
                    between seller and consumer. If the process is
                    utilized correctly, brands will gain loyal customers and increased sales. Users will gain a source
                    of entertainment and access to products that are genuinely enjoyable. And, even once the purchase is
                    complete, the relationship remains and the process of consumption continues, creating the
                    aforementioned loop.

                <h3>TikTok Shop</h3>
                <p>With the launch of TikTok Shop in September of 2023, the social media app became a one-stop-shop.
                    When a video is posted to TikTok, products can be directly linked right above the caption. All users
                    have to do is click the link, add to cart and purchase.
                </p>
                <p>TikTok Shop has been revered for its convenience as well as its affordability. A variety of coupons
                    and discounts are given to users as an incentive to buy. The culture surrounding TikTok Shop is very
                    centered around making consumers feel like they need a product to better themselves or their lives ‚Äì
                    and they should buy it now.

                <p>This video, for instance, is an ad for a vanilla perfume. The creator starts the video with a comment
                    about how she‚Äôs received an array of compliments about the perfume. She speaks in a quick manner to
                    hold audience attention and urges them to buy the product immediately.

                <h3>TikTok Revenue</h3>
                <p>Something that makes TikTok unique from other social media platforms is their hyper awareness of the
                    purchasing power they hold. They want brands to be successful in their business pursuits and
                    actively encourage the ‚Äúinfinite loop.‚Äù </p>
                <p>TikTok has even gone as far as to create <a
                        href="https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/home?ad_platform_id=googleadwords_int_lead&ug_google_tracking_id=G-BZBQ2QHQSP&utm_from=google_inhouse_all&campaign_id=20839378945&adset_id=155583798679&ad_id=683442794304&keyword_id=kwd-1689144763600&channel=g&placement=&target=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw57exBhAsEiwAaIxaZqK_zINkprmyWZBlfpvQbwS4qyQm9pkuUGN4yGuchasdU42uhstaUxoCCyYQAvD_BwE&identity=1&role=seller">TikTok
                        Shop Academy</a>, a series of informational videos that
                    explain everything a seller would need to know in order to navigate TikTok Shop. These videos range
                    from How To Register For TikTok Shop to a Step by Step Guide on How to Create a Shoppable Video.
                </p>
                <p>Clearly, TikTok has a vested interest in TikTok Shop sales. But, what is the company getting out of
                    it monetarily? </p>
                <p> According to TikTok's <a
                        href="https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=2675772847064834&default_language=en&identity=1">
                        Introduction to Seller Fees</a> transaction costs are taken by TikTok Shop after the order has
                    been placed. This is charged to all
                    sellers and is 2.24% of the item's price, regardless of what it is. </p>

                <p>After the item has been delivered, TikTok Shop will automatically deduct a marketplace commission fee
                    that is dependent on what the item is. This fee ranges from 2% to 3.6% of the item‚Äôs price. However,
                    the marketplace commision fees are set to increase on June 1, 2024 to be between 2% and 5%.
                </p>
                <p>TikTok Shop sales have increased tremendously over the past few years, which is in large part due to
                    the push for sellers to become content creators. The numbers speak for themselves.

                <h3>Avoid Getting Scammed</h3>
                <p>Even though TikTok Shop is extremely popular, it has also come under some scrutiny for quality issues
                    and encouraging overconsumption. Some videos have been put on blast for making products look better
                    than they actually are ‚Äì and other advertised products were revealed to be complete scams.</p>

                <p>If you want to buy something on TikTok Shop, but are weary of getting scammed, follow the tips below:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Research the seller before buying. Are they verified?</li>
                    <li>Look over customer reviews. Sometimes pictures of the product are included! If something looks
                        too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
                    <li>Know the return policy. If you end up not liking the product, will you get your money back?</li>
                    <li>Take time to think about the purchase. Impulse buying often results in regretting purchases.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use a credit card. If you need to dispute a purchase, credit cards do not immediately take the
                        money out of your account.
                    </li>
                </ol>
